# Draw Dash!

# What's Draw-Dash?
Draw-Dash is a competitive, 1v1 drawing competition. Authenticated users can join a room to either draw, or watch the competition. When a room has two users, and both have readied up the match begins! The users are given a prompt for what to draw and a timer begins to countdown, and the 60 second Draw Dash begins. When the time is up, both users, along with whoever is in the room watching the competition, vote on which drawing is a better representation of the prompt. After the vote the winner is displayed and their drawing is saved to the gallery. Winner receives three points, loser receives one, and in the case of a tie each receive two points.
